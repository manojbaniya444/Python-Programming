## OOP: The Big Picture
Class: a coding structure and device used to implement new kinds of object in python that support inheritance. They are the mian object oriented tool. OOP offer a different and often effective way of programming, in which we factor code to minimize redundancy and write new programs by customizing existing code instead of changing it in place.

Class are designed to create and manage new objects and support `**inheritance**` which is a mechanism of code customizatiom and reuse above and beyond anything.

## Why class?
- Inheritance
- Composition
- Multiple Instances
- Customization inheritance
- Operator overloading
