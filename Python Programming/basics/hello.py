# Python inner workings
# -> python script.py
# -> Python interpreter
# -> Python code -> Python bytecode -> Python virtual machine
# -> python first converts our code into byte code and then runs it in the virtual machine that python installs
# -> Python is an interpreted language
# -> Python is a dynamically typed language

# Compile to Byte Code
# .pyc -> compiled python
# Byte code is a low level code
# __pycache__ -> folder where python stores the byte code
# -> Byte code runs faster than the source code
# hello.cpython-213.pyc -> hello.py is the source code and cpython-213 is the python version 2.13 -> works only for imported files not for top level files


# PVM ( Python Virtual Machine )
# -> Python Virtual Machine is a software that runs the byte code
# -> Python Virtual Machine is written in C
# -> Python Virtual Machine is also known as Python Interpreter
# -> Python Virtual Machine is platform independent


# Byte code is not machine code
# Byte code is a low level code
# -> Byte code is a python specific interpretation of the source code
# -> CPython is the default implementation of Python
